Configuration
*************

In order to use this truthing protocol, users should have the following software:
 
 * `CAJAL Toolbox <http://github.com/openconnectome/cajal>`_
 * `Ilastik v1.15+ <http://www.ilastik.org/>`_
 * A recent version of MATLAB
 
*This tool uses Ilastik for training and classification, and ocp-ilastik+CAJAL to pull and push data appropriately.  It is not necessary for all annotators to use MATLAB and CAJAL, as long as they have a mechanism (such as a grad student) to help pull and push data.  Machine learners need only to be able to develop and deploy classifiers within ilastik.*
