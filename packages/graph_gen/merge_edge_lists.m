function merge_edge_lists(output_file, varargin)
    % merge_edge_lists This method merges edge lists into a single file
    %
    % varargin should be N strings pointing to mat files to be merged.
    % Each file should contain the variable "edge_list" that is an NxM
    % edge list where N is the number of edges and M is 2 + number of
    % attributes (node1, node2, attribute, attribute)
