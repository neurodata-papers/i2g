function edgeList = synapseAlign(edgeList, edgeServerTest, edgeTokenTest, edgeServerTruth, edgeTokenTruth, resolution, useSemaphore)

% This function is designed to take in an edge list and will map edge
% identifiers to true synapses when possible

% Edges that are unmatched (False Positives), will be indicated with a
% negative ID, with a magnitude equal to the original value

% The edge list will have a 4th column
