## Template for a basic matlab wrapper for the LONI Pipeline##

## It is assumed that the matlab function that is being called does not create files internally and that any
## file that is output is specified by an input argument.  This allows LONI pipeline to generate/manage filenames.
## If you are creating files internally you must use the advanced wrapping scripts
##
## Your matlab function also should not have any outputs.  You can fprintf a string to the command window and
## using LONI extract the result as an output to pass to the next module.  This is much faster than writing files
## if you are only passing a few values between modules. Other than that all outputs
## should be files that are specified by an input filename argument.
##
## In the LONI module that calls this, the first argument should be your function name without the .m extension.
## It must be on the MATLAB search path (everything inside the framework directory structure is).
## Do NOT include a command line prefix.
## All other arguments should be entered into the LONI module in the same order they are in the matlab function call.
## You MUST include command line prefixes for all arguments indicating their type as described in matlabInit.m
##
## Make sure that you specify the environment variable MATLAB_EXE_LOCATION inside the LONI module.  This can be
## set under advanced options on the 'Execution' tab in the module set up.
